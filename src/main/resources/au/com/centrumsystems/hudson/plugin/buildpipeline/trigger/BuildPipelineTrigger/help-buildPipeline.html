    The Build Pipeline View plugin uses the relationship between upstream and downstream projects to map out a build pipeline.
    As default, the downstream project requires a manual trigger when the upstream job is completed.
    Specify the Downstream triggered projects in the "Downstream Project Name" field. Multiple projects can be specified by using comma, like "abc, def".
