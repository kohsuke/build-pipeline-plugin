    This Build Pipeline View plugin uses the relationship between upstream and downstream projects to map out the relationship.
    As default, the downstream project is triggered automatically when the upstream job is completed. If the manual build promotion is required to trigger the downstream job, 
    please select the option "Build Pipeline Plugin -> Specify Downstream Project" under "Post-build Actions" in the JOB configuration page. 
    And then specify the downstream project name and select "Require manual build execution" to enable manual build promotion.
